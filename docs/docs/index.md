# AP Management Api

This is the documentation site for the DataGEMS Analytical Pattern (AP) Management Service. The service is part of the wider [DataGEMS](https://datagems.eu/) platform. This is part of the overall [platform documentation](https://datagems-eosc.github.io/).

The Analytical Pattern (AP) Management component is designed to receive and manage APs that encapsulate the functionalities of the platform’s components on datasets and machine Learning models.
We have initiated the design of AP management primitives that enable the generation of APs for a task, their storage, and their evaluation and comparison along the three dimensions: system, data, and human. These primitives also support retrieving, explaining, executing APs, and displaying their structure and results.
